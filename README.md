### Prerequisites

### Setup

Clone the repo


```
git clone https://github.com/kwizl/smartphone-ecom.git
```


We will be running the microservice project in docker. First install Docker Desktop then install WSL2 (Link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-wsl2-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-windows-10/). 
Switch docker to linux containers if your are on a windows machine. Make sure **docker-compose** is installed. If you are on a linux machine 
**Fedora**:
```
sudo dnf install docker-compose
```

On Debian and its derivatives:
```
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

Arch Linux users can run:
```
sudo pacman -S docker-compose
```

## Usage

Go to the directory where the docker-compose files are and type:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```

when all containers are running open your browser and go to **http://localhost:8009**
